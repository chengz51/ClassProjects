### Tracking the Submarine in the Puget Sound
This report we are hunting for a submarine in the Puget Sound using noisy acoustic data. It is a new subma- rine technology that emits an unknown acoustic frequency that you need to detect. Using a broad spectrum recoding of acoustics, data is obtained over a 24-hour period in half-hour increments. Unfortunately, the submarine is moving, so its location and path need to be determined.
The code and report is trying to locate the submarine and find its trajectory using the acoustic signature. Also identify the acoustic admissions of this new class of submarine. The data is provided and it is named subdata.mat. This contains 49 columns of data for measurements over a 24-hour span at half-hour incre- ments in time.
