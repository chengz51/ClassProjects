### Analyzing a Mass on a Spring
This report we are attempted to find the different displacement of a mass on a spring using the Principle Component Analysis. The specific spring-mass system is given in the video within four cases. The cases are as follows:

1. Test 1: Ideal Case- the entire motion is in the z direction with simple harmonic motion being observed.

2. Test 2: Noisy Case. This one is more difficult to extract the simple harmonic motion. But the dynamics will still be extracted with the PCA algorithms.

3. Test 3: Horizontal Displacement. In this case the mass is released off-centre so as to produce motion in the x − y plane as well as the z direction. 

4. Test 4: Horizontal Displacement and Rotation. In this case the mass is released off-centre and rotates so as to produce rotation in the x − y plane and motion in the z direction.
