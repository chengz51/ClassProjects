### Domain of interest
- **Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
The number of green vehicles in use has been rising in recent years. Electricity ,as one of the green energy, has been discussed widely among the world. Therefore, we wanted to deeper analyze advantages and disadvantages of the green cars on both environment and economy.In this way,we can provide some evidence for future determination on whether we should have more vehicles.

- **What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**
1. https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EV-life-cycle-GHG_ICCT-Briefing_09022018_vF.pdf
This project went compared electric vehicles with vehicles that use fossil fuel, spoke on battery life cycles, and the potential of battery recycling and grid decarbonization on reducing carbon emissions.
2. https://www.iea.org/gevo2018/
This provides an overview at the state of EVs, charging infrastructure and policies around the globe today and also the scenario outlook to 2030.
3. https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions
This provides a historical perspective of how CO2 emissions have evolved which is closely related to how we determine the impact of electric vehicles on the environment, and how emissions are distributed.

- **What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**
1. What’s the impact of the green vehicles have on the environment? ( how much CO2 emission reduction compared to other vehicles.)
2. Are electric vehicles the most efficient and plausible solution to cleaner cars? This can be answered with data by seeing its effectiveness in reducing carbon emissions.
3. What trends come from using electric energy as opposed to fossil fuel? This can be answered with data by analyzing what happens when electric energy is used and comparing it with when fossil fuels are used. For example, electric energy would reduce emissions while fossil fuels would increase emissions.
4. Who could benefit from switching to electric energy? This can be answered with data by looking at who are the biggest perpetrators in carbon emissions and fossil fuel vehicles. The who in this scenario would be the country, population, etc.


### Finding Data
##### Dataset 1
- **Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**
https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10641 - _US Department of Energy_. The data was obtained from the US Department of Energy’s website.
- **How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**
The information was collected by the _Energy Information Administration_ (EIA) and the _Bureau of Labor Statistics_.
- **How many observations (rows) are in your data?**
There are 68 observations
- **How many features (columns) are in the data?**
There are 4 features
- **What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**
The data in this dataset shows that there are benefits to switching away from gasoline considering gas prices are trending upwards and may continue to since gasoline is a finite resource that will dwindle one day.

##### Dataset 2
- **Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**
https://www.kaggle.com/steventaylor11/stated-preferences-for-car-choice
We found it in kaggle.
- **How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**
Steven Taylor scrapped this data from www.qed.econ.queensu.ca.
- **How many observations (rows) are in your data?**
300 rows
- **How many features (columns) are in the data?**
40 columns
- **What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**
This data set includes different vehicles' population in the U.S. from 2016-2018 which helps us better understand the distribution of the green vechicles. We can relate this population distribution to CO2 emission situation to figure the impact on the environment.

##### Dataset 3
- **Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**
We found it in this website  
https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution
- **How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**
Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser gathered the data and produced the report on air pollution.
- **How many observations (rows) are in your data?**
78 rows
- **How many features (columns) are in the data?**
9 columns
- **What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**
We can combine dataset 2 and 3 to figure out if the state with larger green vehicles population have a better air condition which solve the questions of the impact and if green vehicles is a effcient way helping the environment.
