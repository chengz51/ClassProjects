### Background Subtraction in Video Streams
In this report we are using the Dynamic mode decomposition method. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a dimensional reduction algorithm. We would apply it on the given video clips ski drop low.mp4 and monte carlo low.mp4 which contain a foreground and background object. We want to separate the video stream to both the foreground video and a background.
