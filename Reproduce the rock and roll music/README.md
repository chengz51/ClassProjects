### Reproduce the rock and roll music
This report we are analyzing a portion of two of the greatest rock and roll songs of all time using two files. The first one is GNR.m4a (14 second clip) and the second one is Floyd.m4a (60 second clip). These files play clips of the songs Sweet Child O’ Mine by Guns N’ Roses and Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd, respectively. We converted those pieces of music into a vector in order to filter and analyze them. 
The code and report is trying to reproduce the music score for the guitar in the GNR clip, and the bass in the Floyd clip using Gabor filtering and Fourier Transform.
