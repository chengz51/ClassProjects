### Identify the image data
This report we are attempted to train the image data and use different methods to identify the image data. The image data is ranging from digits 0 to 9. We can download the MNIST data set (both training and test sets and labels): http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. To load the MNIST data into MATLAB some starter codes are given in the minist parse.m. \newline
After the data are projected into PCA space, I will build a classifier to identify individual digits in the training set. By building a linear classifier (LDA), I will try to identify 2 random numbers and 2 random numbers and figure out which two digits in the data set are most easy/difficult to separate. At the end, compare the performance between LDA, SVM and decision trees on the hardest and easiest pair of digits to separate.
